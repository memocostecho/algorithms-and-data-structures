/**
 * Dynamic programing question
 *
 * You are climbing a staircase that has n steps. You can take the steps either 1 or 2 at a time. Calculate how many distinct ways you can climb to the top of the staircase.
 * <p>
 * Example
 * <p>
 * For n = 1, the output should be
 * climbingStairs(n) = 1;
 * <p>
 * For n = 2, the output should be
 * climbingStairs(n) = 2.
 * <p>
 * You can either climb 2 steps at once or climb 1 step two times.
